# DeepLearningZero
A deep learning model implemented from scratch using only Numpy.  
The model predicts (cat, non-cat) pictures.

## Steps
1.  Load the train and test data.
2.  Flatten the images into vectors.
3.  Initialise the weights and the bias randomly.
4.  Train the model (Forward pass -> calculate the gradients -> update weights -> backward pass).
5.  Test the model on the test set and calculate the accuracy.

## DataSet
I used a public dataset of cat, non-cat pitures.
-  number of train samples: 209
-  number of test samples: 50  

## Accuracy
on Train data: 99.5%  
on Test data: 70%

## why this project
I implemented this neural network from scratch for the purpose of understanding the math behind it.
